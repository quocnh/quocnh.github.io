## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is pivotal in deriving insights from text data. This tutorial demonstrates an end-to-end application where we process text reviews and predict their star ratings.

We will use Python, the `pandas`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib` libraries for implementation. Key steps include:

- Text cleaning and tokenization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Sentiment-based feature engineering.
- Building and evaluating predictive models.

## Dataset and Preprocessing

We use a public dataset containing text reviews and star ratings. Download and load the dataset using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('reviews.csv')
print(data.head())
