# 2 Pointers Solution
```python []
class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        str = ""
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while(i!=len(word1) or j!=len(word2)):
            if i!=len(word1):
                str += word1[i]
                i+=1
            if j != len(word2):
                str += word2[j]
                j+=1
        return str
```
